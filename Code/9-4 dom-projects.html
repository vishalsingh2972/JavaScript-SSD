//More details about JS
      String(25);//manually convert from a number to a string //here number 25 converted to string 25

      console.log('20' - 7);//special behavior of strings - if a string only contains a number like here '20' and we -or*or/ in this case JS will automatically convert the string into a number(in this case '20' string converted to 20 number)=>'20' - 7=>20 - 7=>13 
      console.log('20' * 7);
      console.log('20' / 7);
      //so these are examples of type coercion or automatic type conversion, however it is not recommended to do math with strings like this because adding works differently as below
      console.log('20' + 7); //207 //so as adding string works differently it is best practise to always do math using numbers, don't do math using strings
     //If we need to it is better to first manually convert all to numbers using the Number() function and then add them      
      console.log(Number('20') + 7);

      //Window object - it is a Built-in object //like we learned previously that the document object represents the webpage, similarly the window object represents the browser 
      //because it represents the browser, everything inside the browser is inside the window object
      //the wepage is present inside the browser so basically the document object that represents the webpage is inside the window object that represents the browser

      window.docoument; //this will give us the same document object that we have been using till now
      window.console; //similarly this will give us the console object that we have been using till now //console is also present inside the browser
      window.console.log('Radhe Radhe'); //this will do the same thing as console.log('Radhe Radhe');
      window.alert; //pop ups are also part of the browser so window.alert; will give us the same alert function that we have been using till now
//However we never again and again type window.docoument or window.console.log(); etc we simply type console.log() and that is because the window object has a shortcut,we don't have to type window. at the front everytime, we can just type document or console.log(); and JS will automatically type/consider window. at the front for us. Therefore window is a built-in object that represents the browser and we don't have to type out window. ourselves because JS adds it for us automatically but still good to know how things work BTS
