      //console.log(5 === '5.00'); //here false
      //In JS we prefer === to check/compare values as == can give errors (like 5 == '5.00' are different as one is a number and other is a string but == gives true) so better to use === instead of == to avoid the conversion behavior

/*
//Truthy and Falsy
//Example 1    
      if(5){ //here 5 is known as a Truthy value because it behaves just like true
        console.log("Paanch");
      }

      if(0){ //here 0 is known as a Falsy value because it behaves just like false
        console.log("Shunya");
      }

//List of Falsy values in JS are 0, false, '', NaN, undefined, null //NaN = Not a Number
//All others not in the falsy values list are Truthy values

//Example 2
      const cartQuantity = 5;
      //const cartQuantity = 0;

      if(cartQuantity) { //will behave in same way as if(cartQuantity > 0) {
        console.log('cart has products'); //this will only get printed if our cart has products
      }

//so if cartQuantity is not zero, suppose cartQuantity=5; then both cartQuantity>0 will give true and cartQuantity will give truthy....so in this case they both behave like true
//similarly if cartQuantity is zero, suppose cartQuantity=0; then both cartQuantity>0 will give false and cartQuantity will give falsy....so in this case also both ebhave like false
//so instead of doing/using the long comparisons cartQuantity>0 in if() we can simply just put cartQuantity and make use of Truthy and Falsy values as a shortcut method

//Truthy and Falsy values also work with logical operators
      console.log(!0);// 0 i.e is falsy value here also behaves as false as console.log(!0); is same as console.log(!false);


      console.log('text' / 5); //output is NaN //we get NaN when we do some invalid math


      let variable1;
      console.log(variable1); //undefined

      //we cannot use undefined with const like we did for let as 'const' declarations must be initialized, so we put undefined to a const variable like below
      const variable2 = undefined;
      console.log(variable2);
*/

//Shortcuts for If-Statements
  //Ternary Operator ?:
      const result = true ? 'statement is correct' : 'statement is wrong';
      //const result = 3>50 ? 'statement is correct' : 'statement is wrong';
      //const result = 0 ? 'statement is correct' : 'statement is wrong';
      console.log(result);


  //Guard Operator &&  
      false && console.log('hello'); //short circuit evaluation -  stops early just runs left part and stops and doesn't even run the code on the right //so we can use value on the left (here false) to block or guard the value on the right (here console.log('hello')) 

      const message = false && 'hello1'; //first value or left value is falsy so guard operator stops off early and the result will be the first value
      //const message = 0 && 'hello1'; //0 is a falsy value
      console.log(message);

      const message2 = true && 'hello2';//first value or left value is not falsy so guard operator does not stops off early and the result will be the second value
      //const message2 = 1 && 'hello2'; //1 is not a falsy value //1 is Truthy
      console.log(message2);
  //Therefore Guard Operator && Stops early(short-circuits) if first value is falsy
  

  //Default Operator ||  
    //Shopping cart example where any currency can be chosen and choosing of currency is optional and if we don't choose a currency we will use the default value or default currency of 'USD'

      const currency = 'EUR' || 'USD'; //currency chosen as EUR //so here Stops early(short-circuits) as first value is truthy //stops at first value(left side) 
      //const currency = null || 'USD'; //no currency chosen //does not Stops early(short-circuits) and goes to second value(default value/default currency) //jumps to right side
      //const currency = NaN || 'USD'; //no currency chosen //jumps to right side
      //const currency = undefined || 'USD'; //no currency chosen //jumps to right side
      //const currency = false || 'USD'; //no currency chosen //jumps to right side
      //const currency = true || 'USD'; //stops at first value(left side)
    
    //so we can use the OR operator to set a default value so when we use the OR operator like this we call it the Default Operator ||
  
      console.log(currency);
      
  //Therefore Default Operator || Stops early(short-circuits) if first value is truthy
